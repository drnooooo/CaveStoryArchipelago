# Installation Instructions

3. Launch the Cave Story Client from the AP Launcher
4. You should be prompted to select the root directory (not executable!) of cave-story-randomizer. This is the folder that contains pre_edited_cs. You can also set this in Client or in hosts.yaml.
5. You must connect to a multiworld before Launching, otherwise there won't be any data files to use.
6. Connect to your multiworld, and press Launch Cave Story when you are ready. You can change your character sprite or whether you want to use the Freeware or Tweaked versions of the game. If you're on Linux you must use Tweaked.
